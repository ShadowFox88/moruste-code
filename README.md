# What is this?
Moruste Code is a morse code CLI tool that encrypts and decrypts messages to
morse code, with a twist - every symbol is an emoji. I did my best to select a
colourful array that best fits and encapsulates the Rust theme and community
(lol)

Periods are ðŸ¦€s
Dashes are ðŸš€s
Spaces are ðŸ¥¢s (crabsticks anyone?)

# Why???
I'm learning Rust and this idea sounded hilarious to a sleep-deprived, 6am me.
Woke up the next day _sane_ and decided I went pretty far with the project, so I
aimed to complete it.

# Setup
TODO

I have no idea.
